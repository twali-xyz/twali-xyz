I, Twali, am the sum of many parts. A decentralized professional services platform interacting, operating, and servicing on-chain. 

A collective composed of individuals, experts, builders, educators, & advisors, intent on destroying the hegemony of so-called "consultancies" by developing a peer-reviewed, validated body of knowledge and an expertise-as-a-service platform. 

It may be easy for you to think of me as an on-chain consultancy, a professional services DAO, and that's a good place to start. Start there. Here. Come with me.

            <p>
            In Twali, there are two types of people: Builders and Experts. 

Experts provide their knowledge and expertise to Builders, who book it, who come to experts for help on projects. 

Which are you
